- Prepare the directory structure:
  
  1) Create components directory in the src folder for all the presentational components.
  2) Create containers directory in the src folder for all the container components.
  3) Create a actions directory with the index.js file where you'll define all the Redux actions.
  4) Create a reducers directory with two files: book.js and index.js. The former will store the functions responsible for actions on Books, and combine all the reducers into one later during development.
  5) Implement the App component:
    - It should only wrap BookList and BooksForm in a div selector and display it.
    - Attach this component to render the function in the main index.js file.

  6) Implement the Book components.
    - It should accept a book object as prop.
    - It should represent a single row in the Books table.

  7) Implement the BooksForm component.
    - It should render a very simple form for adding books. The form should contain a book title input, a select box with categories and a submit button.
    - Define a constant with a collection containing the book categories: [ 'Action', 'Biography', 'History', 'Horror', 'Kids', 'Learning', 'Sci-Fi'];

  8) Initialize the Redux store:
    - Create the initial state object in src/index.js. It may contain just a few books with different titles and categories.
    - Each book in the initial state should have a unique ID. However, we'll cheat here and implement that functionality by using a Math.random function.
    - Render the <App /> component wrapped in <Provider> and pass the store down to the component.
